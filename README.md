# Poem_generation
This is the project I made during my summer intern at Utkrisht USICT.
## Abstract
Text generation is one of the applications that Deep learning could provide in Natural language processing.
Through this project, I aim to use this concept and extend its usage into generating a poem similar to ones made by ‘William Wordsworth’.
 For this I have first made a custom dataset from text files containing poems of William Wordsworth and created a corpus from it.
Thereafter, I used two different ways to generate text/poem:-
-	Markov Chain
-	LSTM(RNN)




## Introduction


Humans have written poems for centuries, and some of us have been able to write great poems and even whole books filled with poems. However, is a computer able to create new poetry by learning from poems written by various artists. 
From machine learning standpoint, this task is purely unsupervised. Neural network architectures, that belong to the autoencoders family, are used in this project. Although convolutional layers have been successfully used for sequence learning, recurrent networks are the most intuitive way to deal with natural language data. For this reason, this project focuses on recurrent networks and also on Markov chain. In this project, the poems are generated using two completely different methods. The first being Markov Chains. The other one is long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks, which is used to generate poems word by word.
In the following sections the data collection procedure is described and also the architectures for networks used in the project. In the final section we summarise the results and discuss possible ways to improve upon the work done so far.


## Problem Statement/Motivation


Text generation is one of the many breakthroughs of machine learning. This breakthrough comes in handy in the world of creative arts through song writing, poems, short stories and even novels. I decided to channel my inner poet by building and training a neural network that generates poems by predicting the next set of words from the seed text using LSTM and also by using Markov chain. LSTMs are the go to models for text generation and its preferred over RNNs because of RNNs vanishing and exploding gradients problems. 
As a first step, let’s rephrase the problem of writing a poem to a prediction problem. Given a poem subject, we want to predict what a poet would write about that subject.
As a second step, let us break down the large prediction problem into a set of smaller ones. The smaller problem is to predict only one word that a poet would write following some given text. Later we will see how to predict a poet’s writing on a subject using one character predictor.

 
## Methodology Adopted
- Data Collection

Most of the poems were collected from website Poetry Foundation.org . I was able to extract 7poems written by William Wordsworth . Saved all these poems in different text files. I made sure that poems had similar words per sentence. Data was cleaned around punctuations and using subword approach the data was first converted into lowercase and tokenized, last means adding whitespace around punctuation characters. After that byte-pair encoding was used to split the data into subwords. At last most used words with their frequency were plotted.

- Markov Chain


A Markov Chain is a stochastic process that models a finite set of states, with fixed conditional probabilities of jumping from a given state to another.
What this means is, we will have an “agent” that randomly jumps around different states, with a certain probability of going from each state to another one.
To show what a Markov Chain looks like, we can use a digraph, where each node is a state (with a label or associated data), and the weight of the edge that goes from node a to node b is the probability of jumping from state a to state b.
Here’s an example, modelling the weather as a Markov Chain.

We can express the probability of going from state a to state b as a matrix component, where the whole matrix characterizes our Markov chain process, corresponding the digraph’s adjacency matrix.

Then, if we represent the current state as a one-hot encoding, we can obtain the conditional probabilities for the next state’s values by taking the current state, and looking at its corresponding row.
After that, if we repeatedly sample the discrete distribution described by the n-th state’s row, we may model a succession of states of arbitrary length.
 
### Markov Chains for Text Generation
 
In order to generate text with Markov Chains, we need to define a few things:
•	What are our states going to be?
•	What probabilities will we assign to jumping from each state to a different one?
We could do a character-based model for text generation, where we define our state as the last n characters we’ve seen, and try to predict the next one.
In this experiment, I will instead choose to use the previous k words as my current state, and model the probabilities of the next token.
In order to do this, I will simply create a vector for each distinct sequence of k words, having N components, where N is the total quantity of distinct words in my corpus.
I will then add 1 to the j-th component of the i-th vector, where i is the index of the i-th k-sequence of words, and j is the index of the next word.
If I normalize each word vector, I will then have a probability distribution for the next word, given the previous k tokens.


- LSTM



I tokenized the corpus file and created input sequences using list of tokens. I padded these sequences and created predictors and labels.
I built the neural network using Keras. I added an embedding layer, bidirectional LSTM, a dropout of 20%, an LSTM and two dense layer consisting of ReLu and softmax activations. I also added regularizer to prevent over-fitting. I compiled the model’s loss using categorical cross-entropy, Adam optimizer and ‘accuracy’ metrics was also used. The summary of the model is as seen below.

I trained the model using 100 epochs and got loss: 2.0985 ,accuracy: 0.5755
. I plotted the model’s accuracy and loss using matplotlib.pyplot and it’s visualized below.

Finally, I inputted a seed text which will be the origin from which the poem will be generated and set the next words to 1000.

## Conclusion and Future work
Both the methods Markov chain and LSTM have shown promising results for poem generation.They generated text as expected, though some parts of the poem sound meaningless, the model can be tweaked to gain higher accuracy and predict more meaningful poems. The next steps should be to figure out how to add rhymes to the poem with appropriate rhyme scheme and have more meanings attached to poems.
